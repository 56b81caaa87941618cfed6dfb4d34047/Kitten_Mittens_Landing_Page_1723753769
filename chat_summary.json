The user emphasized a desire for a detailed onboarding form with information about nodes and various currency tokens for staking. The AI confirmed it would incorporate these elements.\n\nFurther, the AI provided another checklist focusing on user interface aesthetics, including animated gradients and neumorphic designs. The user requested to beautify the form using pink glassmorphism styles. The AI noted it would implement these styles and proposed additional features such as a parallax effect and customizable background color palettes, along with questions about the nebula background's appearance.\n\nThe user requested a pink nebula background for the component, which the AI agreed to incorporate. Later, the user sought details for a node operator signup form and suggested specific fields to include. The AI recognized this by listing relevant features like fields for personal information and stake amount validation, assuring the user it would create a node operator signup and stake submission form. The user then requested to replace the current content with the signup form, prompting the AI to seek clarification about the project.",
