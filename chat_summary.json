The AI acknowledged this input and stated it would focus on creating the signup form and staking process. The user was then presented with a checklist of desired features for the form, including aspects like input fields for personal information and stake amounts, while noting that a submit button, success message, and KYC documentation upload were not yet addressed. The AI confirmed the feature list and then prompted the user for more details about the project after the user requested to replace the existing content with the signup form and stake submission details.",
